What is Swift?
As the title says new learning language I would choose " swift ". Swift is a powerful programming language that includes a maximum of other programming languages such as c++, java, etc. Swift is an open-source programming language and easy to learn, designed by apple.

It is mainly used for ios and macOS development. These days swift is evolving and also has the fastest-growing community.


why swift?

- To explore a new career path
- To make progress and improve me
- Swift has simple and easy syntax to learn and write
- The speed of the code is faster compared to languages 
- Demand is increasing for swift developers 

Concepts in swift 

Variables in swift:

Variables in swift help to keep track of the data we provided

var firstName = "Priya"
print(firstName)

Here, We declare a new variable called "firstName" the var that keeps track of the "firstName". An equal sign indicates the assigned text data to the Name variable.

If you want to use the data we can just refer to the variable "firstName"

firstName = "Rudroju"
print(firstName)

We can reuse the variable only if it has the same data type.

So, in the above example, the variable keeps track of the latest declared data of the same data type.

When you try to re-assign the data in the integer data type or any other data type it shows you an error. There are other ways to keep track of the data if it has a different data type and can use the same variable. These are called  " constants ".

Declaring a constant instead of using the 'var' keyword we can use the 'let' keyword.

let firstName = "vishwak"

The difference between constant and variable is you can use constant once you declare and later you can reassign different data or input but variable can't 
be used.

If you want to declare explicitly a variable that only holds the string data we use:

var firstName:String = "Priya"


Data Types: 
 
var Str:String = "Priya"       //To store piece of text 

var anInt:Int = 10            //Whole numbers positive and negative

var aFloat:Float = 0.2        //Decimal numbers

var aDouble: Double = 0.3     //Large decimal numbers

var aBool = true              //True or False


1) Swift if, if..else statement

The syntax of the if statement in swift is:

if condition {
 
             //body
         }
 
If the condition is evaluated as true the inside code will be executed. 

If the condition is evaluated as false the inside code will be skipped.

For example, 
                                                         
let a = 10                                                  let a = 35
if a <= 10 {                                                if a <= 20 {
print("a is less than 10") }                                Print("a is less than 10") }                                                       
     
                          
The condition is true                                       The condition is false. So, in this case, we use the else if statement

                                                            
                                                            else if a < 25 {
                                                            print("a is less than 15")
                                                            }
                                                            else {
                                                            print("valid") }

The last feature of if statements which is the else clause, is used when none of the statements of the branches are true and if it evaluated as true in the else branch it will be executed inside the else branch.

If you do two variables and want to chain the conditions together and wanted to be true we use operators:
For example: 

if a <= 35 && b > 10  //b is true ,a is not true


you want one of both to be true we use or operator:

if a <= 35 || b > 10
