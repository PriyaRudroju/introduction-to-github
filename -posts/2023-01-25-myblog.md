What is Swift?

As the title says new learning language I would choose " swift ". Swift is a powerful programming language that includes a maximum of other programming languages such as c++, java, etc. Swift is an open-source programming language and easy to learn, designed by apple.

It is mainly used for ios and macOS development. These days swift is evolving and also has the fastest-growing community.


why swift?

- To explore a new career path
- To make progress and improve me
- Swift has simple and easy syntax to learn and write
- The speed of the code is faster compared to languages 
- Demand is increasing for swift developers 

Concepts in swift 

Variables in swift:

Variables in swift help to keep track of the data we provided

    var firstName = "Priya"
    print(firstName)

Here, We declare a new variable called "firstName" the var that keeps track of the "firstName". An equal sign indicates the assigned text data to the Name variable.

If you want to use the data we can just refer to the variable "firstName"

    firstName = "Rudroju"
    print(firstName)

We can reuse the variable only if it has the same data type.

So, in the above example, the variable keeps track of the latest declared data of the same data type.

When you try to re-assign the data in the integer data type or any other data type it shows you an error. There are other ways to keep track of the data if it has a different data type and can use the same variable. These are called  " constants ".

Declaring a constant instead of using the 'var' keyword we can use the 'let' keyword.

    let firstName = "vishwak"

The difference between constant and variable is you can use constant once you declare and later you can reassign different data or input but variable can't 
be used.

If you want to declare explicitly a variable that only holds the string data we use:

    var firstName:String = "Priya"


Data Types: 
 
    var Str:String = "Priya"       //To store piece of text 

    var anInt:Int = 10            //Whole numbers positive and negative

    var aFloat:Float = 0.2        //Decimal numbers

    var aDouble: Double = 0.3     //Large decimal numbers

    var aBool = true              //True or False


1) Swift if, if..else statements

The syntax of the if statement in swift is:

    if condition {
 
             //body
         }
 
If the condition is evaluated as true the inside code will be executed. 

If the condition is evaluated as false the inside code will be skipped.

For example, 
                                                         
    let a = 10                                                 
    if a <= 10 {                                                
    print("a is less than 10")                                 
    }                                                           
     
                          
                                                            The condition is true                                       
                                                            let a = 35
                                                            if a <= 20 {
                                                            print("a is less than 10")
                                                            }


                                       // The condition is false. So, in this case, we use the else if statement

                                                            
                                                            else if a < 25 {
                                                            print("a is less than 15")
                                                            }
                                                            else {
                                                            print("valid") }

                                              
The last feature of if statements which is the else clause, is used when none of the statements of the branches are true and if it evaluated as true in the else branch it will be executed inside the else branch.

If you do two variables and want to chain the conditions together and wanted to be true we use operators:
For example: 

    if a <= 35 && b > 10  //b is true ,a is not true


you want one of both to be true we use or operator:

    if a <= 35 || b > 10 
    
    
Switch statements:

Syntax: 

    switch value to consider {       //The switch statement starts with the keyword "switch" followed by the value being evaluated

    case value1:                  // Inside braces you put all the things/values you wanted to check within the braces, 
                                     multiple cases are specified using the "case" keyword, each with its corresponding code to be 
                                     executed if the value matches
               statement
    case value2:                 
               statement

    default:                     // If none of the cases match, the code under the "default" case will be executed.
               statement
    }


For example:

    let chr = "a"                      

    switch chr {                        //This code uses a switch statement to determine what to print based on the variable "chr" value.

       case "a":                    //If "chr" is equal to "a", it will print "this is a".
             print("this is a")
       default:
             print("none")
    }

Output: 

    this is me                    

By combining multiple cases, the same block of code can be executed for multiple values.

For example,

    let chr = "b"

    switch chr {
       case "a": 
       print("this is a")
       
       case "b", "c":                          //If "chr" is equal to "b" or "c", it will print "this is a b or c". 
       print("this is a b or c")
  
       default:                                  //If none of the cases match, it will print "none"
       print("none")
    }

Output:

    this is a b or c
    
 
For In Loop:

There are 2 keywords to use "For" and "In"

Syntax:

    for counter in lower...upper{                 //counter is a variable name, lower and upper is an inclusive range that we provide
     Code
    }


Here is an example,

    for counter in 1...5 {                        //variable name is counter, specify the lower and upper range followed by a counter variable
    print("hi")
    } 

Output:

    hi
    hi
    hi
    hi
    hi

In a for-in loop, the variable "counter" is used to refer to each iteration and contains the current number. For example, in the first iteration "counter" contains 1, in the second iteration it contains 2, and so on. To display the value of "counter", you can use the print statement, such as "print(counter)".

For example:
Display the sum of all numbers

    var sum = 0
    for counter in 1...5 {

    sum += counter

    }

    print(sum)


Output:

    15

This code uses a for loop to add up the numbers from 1 to 5 and store the result in the variable "sum". In each iteration, the current value of "counter" is added to "sum". After 5 iterations, the final value of "sum" is displayed as the output, which is 15. The sum is continuously updated in each iteration until the loop ends.
